## CryptoStoryBooks

Now, In CryptoStoryBooks, users collect and breed oh-so-adorable StoryBook that we call CryptoStoryBooks! 

Each StoryBook has a unique genome that defines its appearance and traits. 

Players can breed their story to create new StoryBook with friends and unlock rare StoryBookTributes.

CryptoStoryBooks is one of the world’s first blockchain (WeChat)games. 

[Blockchain](https://github.com/yangboz/iStoryBook/wiki/Blockchain) is the technology that makes things like Bitcoin possible. 

While CryptoStoryBooks isn’t a digital currency, it does offer the same security: 

each CryptoStoryBook is one-of-a-kind and 100% owned by you. (PoS)

It cannot be replicated, taken away, or destroyed. 

But It can be selled to offline buyers, support printing, drawing.(PoW)

### PoC by chatgpt

A GPT-based storybook would be a book that is generated by an AI language model using the GPT architecture. The book would consist of a series of interconnected stories, with each story being generated by the model based on a prompt provided by the reader or the model itself. The prompts could be in the form of a sentence, a phrase, or a question.

To create a proof of concept, one could start by training a GPT model on a large dataset of existing stories, such as fairy tales or classic literature. The model could then be fine-tuned on a smaller dataset of prompts and corresponding story outcomes, to ensure that it generates coherent and interesting stories in response to a given prompt.


Once the model is trained and fine-tuned, a proof of concept GPT-based storybook could be generated by providing a set of prompts and allowing the model to generate the corresponding stories. The prompts could be chosen to cover a variety of themes and genres, to demonstrate the model's versatility and range.


The resulting storybook could be evaluated based on several criteria, 

1.such as the coherence and logic of the stories, 
2.the quality of the language and dialogue, 

3.and the overall interest and engagement of the reader. 

If the proof of concept is successful, it could pave the way for the creation of fully automated GPT-based storybooks that could be generated on-demand based on user input or other criteria.
